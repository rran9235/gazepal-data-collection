		<h1> GazePal Data Collection </h1>
		<label for="media">
			Hi, Rishi Rangarajan here. For my undergraduate thesis, I am research gaze tracking technology to control devices with just your gaze! I do require some help to collect additional data to improve my algorithm. Kindly request you to spare 10 minutes to assist me with data collection by following the instructions below. I seek to acquire videos of your eye movements as you gaze at various screen regions, which will help my algorithm predict user gaze with a higher accuracy and give it the ability to generalise to any user's eyes.

		<h2> Instructions: </h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Read these instructions before clicking "Next".</li>
			<li>Fill in the form and click "Submit". The form collects information only to help organise the data.</li>
			<li>You will be shown a visual marker to fixate upon for the recording.</li>
			<li>You will need to gaze at the marker for a 10 second period without distraction.</li>
			<li>The process will be repeated as the marker moves to various screen regions.</li>
			<li>The output will generate several video (.mp4) and text (.txt) files prefixed with "GazePal".</li>
			<li>Please share these videos with me so I can improve my machine learning algorithm</li>
		</ol>
