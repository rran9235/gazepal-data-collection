		<p>Hi, Rishi Rangarajan here. For my thesis, I am developing a gaze tracking system to control devices looking at various parts of a computer screen.
		<br><br>I am requesting your help to collect additional data to help my machine learning algorithm generalise better. Crowd-sourcing gaze data will help me create a dataset with a wide variety of eye shapes, colours, head poses, screen sizes, etc.
		<br><br>Kindly request you to spare about 10 minutes and assist me by following the instructions below. The process involves filling in a user data form and recording your eye movements as you follow a marker that moves around the screen.</p>

		<ol>
			<!-- <li>Watch the video to understand the process.</li> -->
			<li>Enter full-screen on your browser (F11 on Windows).</li>
			<li>Fill in the form and download the data as a '.txt' file .</li>
			<li>Use the webcam preview to check if your eyes are visible in the video stream.</li>
			<li>Click 'Start Recording' once ready to begin data collection.</li>
			<li>Remember to grant permission for the program to access your webcam for recording.</li>
			<li>Focus your eyes on the red marker and follow it as it moves around the screen.</li>
			<li>After the animation is completed, use the 'Download' button to download the recorded video.</li>
			<li>Share the downloaded '.mp4' and '.txt' files via email on rran9235@uni.sydney.edu.au</li>
