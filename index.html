		<h1> GazePal Data Collection </h1>
		<p>Hi, Rishi Rangarajan here. For my thesis, I am developing a gaze tracking system to control devices with just your eyes! I require your help to collect additional data to improve my machine learning algorithm. Crowd-sourcing gaze data collection will help collect data for a wide variety of eye shapes, colours, etc. to help my algorithm generalise better. Kindly request you to spare about 10 minutes to assist me by following the instructions below. The application will collect some basic user information from you and record your eye movements as you follow a marker that moves around the screen.</p>
		
		<h2> Instructions: </h2>
