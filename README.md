# GazePal Data Collection Program
Author: Rishi Rangarajan <br />

## Info
This repository contains the source code for GazePal's data collection program, which generates gaze data through crowd-sourcing. The data is used to train GazePal's Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The program collects video recordings of the user through their PC's integrated webcam while they are required to follow an animated marker that traverses through various regions on the screen. The video recording can be downloaded at the end of the session and processed to extract and annotate gaze data.

GazePal is a Machine Learning-based Gaze Tracking System for users with Severe Speech and Motor Impairments. GazePal is a hardware-agnostic solution, which estimates the user's gaze to a region on the screen using just a video feed from the PC's integrated webcam. GazePal allows its users to view their ambient environment without turning their heads. The user's gaze is used as an input modality to control the GUI, which allows them to adjust the orientation of a pan-tilt mechanism. A scene camera (external USB webcam) is mounted on top of this structure, which allows users to control where the camera is pointed towards. <br/>
